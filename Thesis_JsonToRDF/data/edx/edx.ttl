They debunk the concept of innovation as a linear process, from research to development to product in the market. They present a simple model for understanding it as a highly iterative process, in which you cycle repeatedly through many factors in the areas of Technology, Market and Implementation -- until the right pieces come together. Prof. Fitzgerald tells the story of his own major innovation, tracing it along the winding path into products we use every day.

A primary focus will be on studying existing behavior and using key findings for design. While writing the code for an app is a part of the class, the majority of the topics will cover designing and evaluating a unique mobile experience. Along the way, you will have opportunities to share your work with other students from around the world!

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</p>\n<p><em>Image: Hands at the Cuevas de las Manos upon R\u00EDo Pinturas, near the town of Perito Moreno in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be \"nasty, brutish and short\"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.<br><br>\n\tAt the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.<br><br>\n\tAll required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press and Perseus Books Group.

This course focuses on creating successful global business innovations in health care that can better meet consumer and societal needs. At its end, you should understand the how to evaluate opportunities and the elements of viable business models for different kinds of health care innovations.</p>\n\n<p>Innovating in Health Care (IHC) enables participants to <strong>meet and interact</strong> with others who are also interested in improving health care. The course focuses on evaluating and crafting business models that attain alignment between an entrepreneurial health care venture and the six factors that critically shape new health care ventures - Financing, Structure, Public Policy, Consumers, Technology, and Accountability. Innovating in Health Care discusses the impact of these factors on business models for three different kinds of innovations: consumer-focused, technology-driven, and integrations which create scale.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn:</p>\n\n<ul><li>How to distinguish successful innovations from those likely to fail</li>\n\t<li>How to determine if an innovation is aligned with its environment</li>\n\t<li>Which elements make up a viable competitive strategy for an innovative health care venture</li>\n\t<li>How other elements combine to create a feasible business model for an innovative health care venture</li>\n\t<li>How to create a business plan</li>\n</ul><p>The course is conducted through lectures about assessing and creating a business plan and with case studies that describe decisions facing real entrepreneurial health firms and requires you to analyze these potential decisions through the IHC framework. Participants are taught how to use the case method and how to evaluate business plans. In addition, these lessons are highlighted by insights from the top global health care innovators.</p>\n\n<p>The course will be offered in two formats: an open, online experience and a more limited, team-based deep dive experience, where teams (self-assembled or newly created online) can produce actual business plans evaluated by peer teams and the Innovating in Health Care course instructors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The course syllabus can be accessed <a href=\"https://studio.edx.org/c4x/HarvardX/BUS5.1x/asset/HarvardX_BUS5_1x_Syllabus_2014T1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The International Journal of Care Coordination will publish a special issue on Healthcare Innovation to Improve Care Coordination. Course participants are invited to submit their business models for healthcare innovation, methods for the development or evaluation of such models, and study proposals for evaluation of healthcare innovation for this special issue. Course participants will receive additional information at the start of the course.

In many parts of the world we take the availability of these services for granted. Without conscious reflection on the technological systems that bring these services to where we use them, we are becoming increasingly dependent on a secure, uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services. They create the conditions for liveability and economic development. However, today's infrastructure systems are in a process of drastic change, as they are becoming more and more web-based, transnational and privatized, while new technologies are on their way. The outcome of these changes is difficult to predict.</p>\n<p>In this course we will explore the challenges of infrastructure design, management and governance for the future. Some of the questions that will be addressed:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tWhat are the major changes and drivers when it comes to infrastructure development?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWhat makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHow can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill they become accessible for all global citizens, always and everywhere?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill they remain affordable for future generations?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill they exhaust the natural environment?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWill established infrastructure systems be disrupted by technological innovations?</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHow about security and privacy?</li>\n</ul><p>In this course you will learn to look at these challenges from a new combined engineering and social science perspective. We will explain, for example, how public values are expressed in infrastructure design, and how regulation dictates technology choices. It is all about dealing with complexity in the design, management and governance of infrastructure.</p>\n<p>If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's (next generation) infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will highlight a large number of case studies.</p>\n<p>In the follow-up course, starting in September 2014, you will have the opportunity to study a specific infrastructure in more detail and explore ways to improve its resilience, security, affordability and flexibility. What is the potential of so-called smart grids? How to design infrastructure for the smart cities of the future?</p>\n<p>The course is based on the results of an extensive and renowned international research programme titled '<a href=\"http://www.nextgenerationinfrastructures.eu/index.php?pageID=1&amp;language=en\" target=\"_blank\">Next Generation Infrastructures</a>' (NGInfra). To celebrate this MOOC, we will invite the two best performing students in this course to the International Symposium for Next Generation Infrastructure, 29 Sept. \u2013 2 Oct. 2014 in Vienna, Austria \u2013 and cover their travel and accommodation costs.</p></span>" .

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p></span>" .

Over four centuries, Harvard University has amassed an astonishing array of tangible things\u2014books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The university not only owns a Gutenberg bible, it also cares for Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century \u201Cspirit writing\u201D chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau\u2019s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History museums not only preserve dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.</p>\n<p>By learning how and why such things got here, you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. While this course will not draw on all of these items, it will highlight several to give students a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.</p>\n<p>In the first section we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard\u2019s history, and you will learn the importance of stopping to look at the things around you.</p>\n<p>In the next section we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will consider ways of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.</p>\n<p>Along the way you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.</p></span>" .

Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n<hr><p>CS 169.2x is the second half of University of California, Berkeley's semester long course on Software as a Service. In the first half of the course, CS 169.1x, students use Agile development methods to deploy a simple SaaS app in the cloud. In the second half, CS 169.2x, students create more sophisticated apps by adding relationships between models in apps and by enhancing their apps with JavaScript. They also learn about what happens after the apps are deployed to real users, including how to monitor performance, identify and fix common performance problems, and avoid compromising customer data. Finally, students learn how to apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code, a critical skill for professional programmers.</p>\n<p>Other topics covered in CS 169.2x include:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tHow to form, organize and manage small programming teams</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIntroduction to design patterns: what they are and how to recognize opportunities to apply them</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tUsing Rails for more advanced features like third-party authentication and elegantly expressing design patterns that arise frequently in SaaS</li>\n</ul><p>There will be three homework assignments: two programming assignments and one assignment about operations/deployment. There will also be several short quizzes.</p>\n<p>This run of the class includes all new videos, embedded live chat and opportunities for remote pair programming with other students. Group tutorial Q&amp;A sessions will also be held and broadcast live through Google Hangouts and YouTube.\u00A0</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00A0</p></span>" .

Students appreciate our unique approach to teaching linear algebra because:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tIt\u2019s visual.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIt connects hand calculations, mathematical abstractions, and computer programming.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIt illustrates the development of mathematical theory.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIt\u2019s applicable.</li>\n</ul><p>In this course, you will learn all the standard topics that are taught in typical undergraduate linear algebra courses all over the world, but using our unique method, you'll also get more! LAFF was developed following the syllabus of an introductory linear algebra course at The University of Texas at Austin taught by Professor Robert van de Geijn, an expert on high performance linear algebra libraries. Through short videos, exercises, visualizations, and programming assignments, you will study Vector and Matrix Operations, Linear Transformations, Solving Systems of Equations, Vector Spaces, Linear Least-Squares, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In addition, you will get a glimpse of cutting edge research on the development of linear algebra libraries, which are used throughout computational science.</p>\n<p>We invite you to LAFF with us!</p></span>" .

Join us on a journey that will unravel how these electronic gadgets are designed, developed, and built as embedded systems that shape the world.</p>\n<p>This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. Each student will purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state of the art ARM Cortex M4 processor. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem-solving building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will be able to build your own arcade-style game.</p>\n<p>We will provide instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software via the <a href=\"http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/edX/\" target=\"_blank\">course website</a>.\u00A0</p>\n<p>And be sure to connect with us on<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/UT601x/189482187906969\" target=\"_blank\"> Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utembeddedsys\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/118066825067796426836/posts\" target=\"_blank\">Google Plus</a>!</p></span>" .

Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n<hr><p>8.01x is an online version of Classical Mechanics, which is the first of MIT's introductory physics courses. The course covers the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics, fluid mechanics and kinetic gas theory. A variety of other interesting topics are covered, such as resonance phenomena, musical instruments and astronomical phenomena such as binary stars, neutron stars, black holes, stellar collapse, and supernovae. You will also be given a peek into the intriguing world of quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>The course follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the fall of 1999. This includes his video lectures, problem solving sessions, and, of course, his famous in-class demonstrations. Professor Lewin, proclaimed \"a Web Star\" by The New York Times, has supplemented his lectures by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves.</p>\n<p>You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and exams to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions to be answered. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced, the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the interactive questions during the lectures (10%), homework problems (15%), three midterm exams (15% each), and the final exam (30%). Your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%), B (70-85%), C (60-70%). At least 60% must be obtained to qualify for a certificate.</p>\n<p>The book is available on line without charge, but you can also buy a <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119918022.html\" target=\"_blank\">printed copy of the book</a>\u00A0(publisher Wiley). Since the book is a record of things you will soon forget, Professor Lewin recommends you buy the book if you can afford it.</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE LECTURES</strong></p>\n<p>Lewin's lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle, reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs were aired 24 hours per day and were frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally, his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics, 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT'S OpenCourseWare, iTunes U, YouTube and Academic Earth. About 5000 people daily from all over the world watch these lectures - that's about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their classrooms. Bill Gates even wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once and he has learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p></span>" .

At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n<hr><p>8.02 is the second semester of the MIT introductory physics sequence. Passing the online version of this course will guarantee you an MITx certificate of achievement The course is on electricity and magnetism which are at the heart of Maxwell's equations. We will study electric fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic forces, conductors and dielectrics, electromagnetic waves, and the nature of light. This online version follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the spring of 2002, and includes his video lectures and problem solving sessions. Professor Lewin, proclaimed \"a Web Star\" by The New York Times, has supplemented his lectures specifically for 8.02x by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves. Also, the course uses prize-winning animations and interactive simulations developed under the leadership of Professor John Belcher for MIT's Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) classroom.</p>\n<p>In addition to the basic concepts of Electromagnetism, a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course including: Lightning, Electric Shock Treatment, Electrocardiograms, Metal Detectors, Musical Instruments, Magnetic Levitation, Bullet Trains, Electric Motors, Radios, TV, Car Coils, Superconductivity, Aurora Borealis, Rainbows, Radio Telescopes, Interferometers, Particle Accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, Mass Spectrometers, Red Sunsets, Blue Skies, Haloes around Sun and Moon, Color Perception, Doppler Effect, Big-Bang Cosmology.</p>\n<p>You will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and a series of exams using multiple choice, numerical and symbolic questions to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions that must be answered before advancing to the next lecture segment. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced, the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on interactive questions during the lectures (5%), homework problems and simulations (20%), three midterm exams (15% each), and the final exam (30%). Depending on what percentage of all the points you get, your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%), B (70-85%), C (60-70%). At least 60% of the points must be obtained to qualify for a certificate of mastery.</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE LECTURES</strong><br>\n\tLewin's lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle, reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs, which were aired 24 hours per day, were also frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally, his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics, 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT'S OpenCourseWare, iTunes U, YouTube and Academic Earth. These lectures are being watched by about 5000 people daily from all over the world, that's about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their class rooms, and Bill Gates wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once, and that he learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.</p></span>" .

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. We explain the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. We present declarative dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and show how it avoids race conditions. We give a simple formal semantics for all concepts and illustrate them with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. This course is targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the practical organization of the course, watch our second introductory video: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/M0Dlswd_hIQ\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/M0Dlswd_hIQ</a></p>\n<p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/concepts-techniques-and-models-computer-programming\" target=\"_blank\">The MIT Press</a>.

If you work with young children, you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development, providing support for children\u2019s appropriate behavior, and preventing challenging behavior. In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children.</p>\n<p>The overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others, share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice.</p>\n<p>When you have finished this course, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tIdentify adult child interactions that are emotionally supportive and that build positive relationships.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDescribe classroom management skills that prevent challenging behavior and increase active engagement in early learning.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tObserve and record a functional behavior assessment of a child in an early care setting.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWrite an individualized behavior support plan based on findings from the functional behavior assessment.</li>\n</ul></span>" .

This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.\u00A0 Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law \u2013 in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward \u2013 to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor \u2013 a natural d\u00E0o.</p>\n<p>We will look at two rival directions this natural d\u00E0o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the d\u00E0o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance \u2013 Medieval Chinese Buddhism.</p>\n<p>Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</p></span>" .

Central to the account are the road to emancipation, the role of black soldiers, the nature of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wartime leadership, internal dissent in both the North and South, the changing position of women in both societies, and the war\u2019s long-term economic and intellectual impact.\u00A0 We end with a look at the beginnings of Reconstruction during the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>This course is part of the series, <em>Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, which introduces students to\u00A0perhaps the most pivotal era in American history. \u00A0The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. \u00A0It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation \u2013 the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. \u00A0The series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. \u00A0One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history \u2013 how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.</p></span>" .

You will be guided through the poem by means of the \"MyDante\" Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante's interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life.</p>\n<p>You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as\u00A0<span>you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity and responsibility as a person.</span></p>\n<p><strong>This module is the first of three modules that compose the full course. This module will take you through <em>Vita Nuova</em> and <em>Inferno</em>. Modules on <em>Purgatorio</em> and <em>Paradiso</em> will be offered in the spring of 2015 and will be available for registration in the future.</strong></p></span>" .

It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University\u2019s MOOCs.\u00A0</p>\n<p>Addressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students\u2019 understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students\u2019 horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.</p>\n<p>\u8BFE\u7A0B\u6240\u6D89\u4E0D\u4EC5\u6DB5\u76D6\u53E4\u5178\u97F3\u4E50\u5982\u65B0\u53E4\u5178\u4E3B\u4E49\u3001\u8868\u73B0\u4E3B\u4E49\u3001\u6C11\u65CF\u4E3B\u4E49\u7B49\u6D41\u6D3E\uFF0C\u4E5F\u5BF9\u7235\u58EB\u4E50\u3001\u6447\u6EDA\u4E50\u4E0E\u6D41\u884C\u97F3\u4E50\u572820\u4E16\u7EAA\u7684\u98CE\u683C\u60C5\u72B6\u6295\u4EE5\u6DF1\u5207\u5173\u6CE8\uFF1B\u5728\u5C06\u5305\u62EC\u4E2D\u56FD\u97F3\u4E50\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4E16\u754C\u5404\u56FD\u6C11\u65CF\u6C11\u95F4\u97F3\u4E50\u7EB3\u516520\u4E16\u7EAA\u5927\u80CC\u666F\u4E88\u4EE5\u7814\u7A76\u63A2\u7D22\u4E4B\u540C\u65F6\uFF0C\u5173\u4E8E\u5927\u578B\u7EFC\u5408\u827A\u672F\u54C1\u4F8B\u5982\u6B4C\u5267\u3001\u97F3\u4E50\u5267\u3001\u7535\u5F71\u97F3\u4E50\u7684\u8003\u5BDF\u4E0E\u5206\u6790\uFF0C\u4E5F\u8BBE\u4E3A\u4E13\u9898\uFF0C\u7EDD\u65E0\u504F\u5E9F\u3002</p>\n<p>\u8BFE\u7A0B\u4EE520\u4E16\u7EAA\u897F\u65B9\u97F3\u4E50\u4E3A\u4E3B\u4F53\u5185\u5BB9\uFF0C\u5728\u6E05\u6670\u8D2F\u7A7F\u5386\u53F2\u7EBF\u7D22\u548C\u4FA7\u91CD\u53F2\u89C2\u53D1\u5C55\u4E4B\u540C\u65F6\uFF0C\u5C24\u4E3A\u5F3A\u8C03\u97F3\u4E50\u8046\u542C\u80FD\u529B\u7684\u57F9\u517B\uFF0C\u589E\u8FDB\u97F3\u4E50\u77E5\u8BC6\u7684\u79EF\u7D2F\uFF0C\u51F8\u663E\u7406\u8BBA\u4E0E\u5B9E\u8DF5\u76F8\u7ED3\u5408\u7684\u5F00\u8BFE\u7406\u5FF5\u3002\u4EC0\u4E48\u662F\u97F3\u4E50\u3001\u4EC0\u4E48\u662F20\u4E16\u7EAA\u897F\u65B9\u97F3\u4E50\u3001\u4EC0\u4E48\u662F\u6709\u6548\u8046\u542C\u6210\u4E3A\u5168\u8BFE\u6838\u5FC3\u77E5\u8BC6\u652F\u67F1\uFF0C\u5F15\u5BFC\u5B66\u751F\u63A2\u67E5\u5173\u4E8E20\u4E16\u7EAA\u897F\u65B9\u97F3\u4E50\u7684\u4E09\u79CD\u8046\u542C\u6A21\u5F0F\uFF0C\u4EE5\u671F\u5BF9\u5173\u4E8E20\u4E16\u7EAA\u897F\u65B9\u97F3\u4E50\u6587\u5316\u8BF8\u591A\u73B0\u8C61\u5F62\u6210\u591A\u89C6\u89D2\u3001\u591A\u7EF4\u5EA6\u3001\u591A\u65B9\u6CD5\u3001\u591A\u63A5\u53E3\u7684\u8BA4\u8BC6\u4E0E\u7406\u89E3\uFF0C\u4ECE\u800C\u4E3A\u5B66\u751F\u5F00\u62D3\u773C\u754C\u3001\u89E6\u7C7B\u65C1\u901A\u3001\u591A\u5B66\u79D1\u4EA4\u53C9\u3001\u521B\u9020\u529B\u4E4B\u53D1\u5C55\uFF0C\u5B8C\u7F8E\u4EBA\u683C\u4E4B\u5F62\u6210\uFF0C\u63D0\u4F9B\u5B9E\u9645\u800C\u624E\u5B9E\u7684\u670D\u52A1\u3002</p>\n<p>The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. \u8BE5\u8BFE\u7A0B\u662F\u201C\u5317\u5927-\u5FB7\u7A3B\u7F51\u7EDC\u5F00\u653E\u8BFE\u7A0B\u201D\u4E2D\u7684\u4E00\u95E8\uFF0C\u7531\u5317\u4EAC\u5927\u5B66\u4E0E\u5FB7\u7A3B\u6559\u80B2\u8054\u5408\u63D0\u4F9B\u3002</p></span>" .

Unit processes involved in the treatment chain will be described as well as the physical, chemical and biological processes involved. There will be an emphasis on water quality and the functionality of each unit process within the treatment chain.\u00A0 After the course one should be able to recognise the process units, describe their function and make simple design calculations on urban sewage treatment plants.</p>\n<p>The course consists of 6 modules:</p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tSewage treatment plant overview. In this module you will learn what major pollutants are present in the sewage and why we need to treat sewage prior to discharge to surface waters. The functional units will be briefly discussed</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tPrimary treatment. In this module you learn how coarse material, sand &amp; grit are removed from the sewage and how to design primary clarification tanks</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tBiological treatment. In this module you learn the basics of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous cycle and how biological processes are used to treat the main pollutants of concern.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tActivated sludge process. In this module you learn the design principles of conventional activated sludge processes including the secondary clarifiers and aeration demand of aeration tanks.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tNitrogen and phosphorus removal. In this module you learn the principles of biological nitrogen removal as well as phosphorus removal by biological and/or chemical means.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSludge treatment. In this module you will the design principles of sludge thickeners, digesters and dewatering facilities for the concentration and stabilisation of excess sewage sludge. Potentials for energy recovery via the produced biogas will be discussed as well as the direct anaerobic treatment of urban sewage in UASB reactors when climate conditions allow.</li>\n</ol><p>The course consists of knowledge clips, movies, exercises, discussion and homework assignments. The course will be finished by an examination. The best students (based on results and activity in the forum discussions) will be invited to follow an online course of the MSc-track Water management of the faculty of Civil Engineering at the TU Delft.</p>\n<p>Last year this course was given as part of Introduction to water treatment.

Thanks to medical innovations in the past 50 years, many diseases and conditions have been either mitigated or even cured through medicine. How does a research innovation turn into a therapeutic medicine that health care providers prescribe to patients? This course explores the process, challenges and issues in developing pharmaceutical products. Drug development is a dynamic field where innovation and entrepreneurship are necessary to keep up with health care expectations, strict regulations and tightening development budgets. An overview of drug development, approval, and consumer issues will be presented and discussed in the context of research practices, science, marketing, public welfare and business. Participants from all backgrounds and interest, including scientists, healthcare professionals, entrepreneurs and the general public, are encouraged to participate.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p></span>" .

Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.</p></span>" .

Students will learn how to identify high-performing nonprofit organizations and fulfill their personal goals for giving. Six compact classes are comprised of lectures, interactive exercises, group discussions, and interviews with prominent philanthropists Warren Buffett, Doris Buffet, Cal Ripken, Jr., Soledad O\u2019Brien, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (Ben and Jerry), Tom Werner, and Patrick Dempsey. Students will also be invited to nominate nonprofit organizations in their communities to receive real-dollar grants. A minimum of $100,000 will be distributed to the organizations ranked highest by students using a peer-review selection process based on course concepts.</p>\n<p>To receive a certificate of completion, students must complete 1-2 brief exercises per class, participate in discussion sessions, and complete weekly assessments of their peers\u2019 grant nominations. All students are welcome, but not required, to submit grant nominations.</p>\n<p><span>EdX is proud to support to the The Learning by Giving Foundation and to offer the Giving With Purpose course on <a href=\"http://www.edx.org\" target=\"_blank\">edx.org</a>. As a not-for-profit, edX is proud to support organizations looking to affect global change.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Note to students: </strong><span>The grant making associated with Giving With Purpose is currently limited to nonprofit organizations in the United States. Throughout the course, the instructor will be referring to charitable giving in the context of the United States\u2019 economy, history, and civil society. However, you will be able to apply many of the principles the course will cover about investing in high performing nonprofit organizations anywhere in the world. Through the course Discussion, you are welcome to share your observations about how charitable giving in your country is different from in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.\u00A0</span><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a><span>.</span></p></span>" .

Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued.</em></p>\n<p>Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it\u2019s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn\u2019t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one\u2019s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life.</p>\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.</p>\n<p><u>Course goal:</u></p>\n<p>The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tpurposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tpossesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tis compassionate towards self and others,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tdemonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tfocuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.</li>\n</ul><p><u>Course supporting objectives: </u>When you complete this course, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tDescribe why \u2018functioning from the inside out\u2019 is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person\n\t\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t\tExplain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life</li>\n\t\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDirectly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:\n\t\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t\tMindfulness practices</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tStrategies to manage intense emotions</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tActivities that induce positive emotions</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tClarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tMaking health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being</li>\n\t\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDescribe why \u2018practicing\u2019 and integrating resilience skills into one\u2019s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDevelop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future</li>\n</ul></span>" .

It aims to frame global health's collection of problems and actions within a particular biosocial perspective. It develops a toolkit of analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. The teaching team, four physician-anthropologists, draws on experiences working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas, to investigate what the field of global health may include, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in expected and unexpected ways. The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:</p>\n<p><em>A global awareness.</em> This course aims to enable students to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and wellbeing. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.</p>\n<p><em>A grounding in social and historical analysis.</em> The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.</p>\n<p><em>An ethical engagement.</em> Throughout the course, students will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Students will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities</p>\n<p><em>A sense of inspiration and possibility.</em> While the overwhelming challenges of global health could, all too easily, engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, students learn that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world\u2019s poorest and suffering people.</p></span>" .

We will focus on applications common in public health and biomedical research: measuring gene expression differences between populations, associated genomic variants to disease, measuring epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation, and transcription factor binding sites.</p>\n<p>The course covers the necessary statistical concepts needed to properly design experiments and analyze the high dimensional data produced by these technologies. These include estimation, hypothesis testing, multiple comparison corrections, modeling, linear models, principle component analysis, clustering, nonparametric and Bayesian techniques. Along the way, students will learn to analyze data using the R programming language and several packages from the Bioconductor project.</p>\n<p>Currently, biomedical research groups around the world are producing more data than they can handle. The training and skills acquired by taking this course will be of significant practical use for these groups. The learning that will take place in this course will allow for greater success in making biological discoveries and improving individual and population health.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more.</a></p></span>" .

Do you know computational methods but do not realize how they apply to biological problems? Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: the Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give students exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. For the last few years, the Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx, we can give more students from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages students to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses. </p>\n<p>We expect that students from 7.00x Introduction to Biology \u2013 The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. So students with programming experience will find some weeks easier than students with only biology experience, while 7.00x students should find the week on genetics easier than students without that experience. We recommend that students try to complete each week to find what interests them the most.</p>\n<p>Workshop Content Creators and Residential Leaders<br>\nGregory Hale, Michael Goard, Ph.D., Ben Stinson, Kunle Demuren, Sara Gosline, Ph.D., Glenna Foight, Leyla Isik, Sami El-Boustani, Ph.D., Gerald Pho, and Rajeev Rikhye</p>\n<p>Residential Outreach Workshop Organizer and Creator<br>\nMandana Sassanfar, Ph.D.</p>\n</span>" .

Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n<hr><p>What is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of <em>The Ancient Greek Hero</em>, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.</p>\n<p>The classical Greeks' concepts of Heroes and the \"heroic\" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.</p>\n<p>In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship \u2013 a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.</p>\n<p>The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue \"On Heroes\" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach's opera <em>Tales of Hoffman</em> to Ridley Scott's science fiction classic <em>Blade Runner</em>).</p>\n<p>The true hero of the course is the logos (\"word\") of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or \"slow\") reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer's epics and ends with Plato's memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.</p>\n<p>Using modern technology and engaging texts, <em>The Ancient Greek Hero </em>provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Earn academic credit for this course through\u00A0<a href=\"https://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/concepts-hero-classical-greek-civilization?utm_source=edx.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ancientgreek\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Extension School</a>:\u00A0</strong></h3>\n<p>Academic credit can be earned for this course by completing additional work through Harvard Extension School in conjunction with the course materials on edX.\u00A0<a href=\"http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/13404?utm_source=edx.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ancientgreek\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more...</a></p></span>" .

It is an inclusive, general introductory course, combining natural and cultural geography with history and art. Through the lens of humanism and independent thinking, learners will be encouraged to observe and analyze cultural phenomena from spatial and time perspectives. This course has 12 chapters: The basic research method of world cultural geography; The division of world culture areas; The world's population distribution and migration of population; Origin of agriculture; Diffusion and regional differences; The origin and spread of the city; Regional differences and characteristics of urban morphology; The spatial distribution of the major languages, religions, ethnicities in the world and their relationship; The great geographical discovery and the formation of the world colonial system; World geopolitics and the spatial structures of the world geography system; Global economic integration; Urbanization and its political, economic, social impacts. Using relevant domestic and foreign textbooks, publications, maps, photos, and charts to show the difference and the changing progress of spatial patterns of the cultures, learners will be asked to observe and analyze cultural phenomena with geographic and spatial vision and to consider the development and changing process of the cultural phenomena in light of time sequence. The course will include a midterm and final exam.</p>\n<p>\u300A\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u300B\u662F\u4ECB\u7ECD\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u7684\u683C\u5C40\u3001\u5F62\u6210\u3001\u53D1\u5C55\u8FC7\u7A0B\uFF0C\u57F9\u517B\u5B66\u751F\u7528\u5730\u7406\u5B66\u7684\u773C\u5149\u53BB\u89C2\u5BDF\u548C\u5206\u6790\u4E16\u754C\u4E0A\u6587\u5316\u73B0\u8C61\u7684\u53D1\u751F\u3001\u53D1\u5C55\u4E0E\u7A7A\u95F4\u5206\u5E03\u7279\u70B9\u3002 \u300A\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u300B\u662F\u5317\u4EAC\u5927\u5B66\u6700\u53D7\u672C\u79D1\u751F\u540C\u5B66\u6B22\u8FCE\u7684\u901A\u9009\u8BFE\u4E4B\u4E00\u3002\u8BFE\u7A0B\u5185\u5BB9\u4FE1\u606F\u91CF\u5F88\u5927\uFF0C\u5305\u7F57\u4E07\u8C61\uFF0C\u628A\u4E16\u754C\u5730\u7406\u540C\u4E16\u754C\u5386\u53F2\u3001\u6587\u5316\u3001\u827A\u672F\u7B49\u878D\u5408\u5728\u4E00\u8D77\u3002\u4EFB\u8BFE\u6559\u5E08\u5E26\u9886\u5B66\u751F\u7528\u5730\u7406\u7A7A\u95F4\u7684\u89C2\u70B9\u3001\u65F6\u95F4\u53D8\u5316\u7684\u89D2\u5EA6\uFF0C\u53BB\u89C2\u5BDF\u548C\u5206\u6790\u4E16\u754C\u4E0A\u7684\u6587\u5316\u73B0\u8C61\u3002\u8BFE\u7A0B\u5185\u5BB9\u517C\u5177\u79D1\u5B66\u6027\u548C\u8DA3\u5473\u6027\uFF0C\u6BCF\u5E74\u5438\u5F15\u4E86\u5927\u91CF\u5B66\u751F\u9009\u8BFE\u3002\u00A0 \u300A\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u300B\u5177\u4F53\u5185\u5BB9\u5305\u62EC\uFF1A\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u7684\u57FA\u672C\u7814\u7A76\u65B9\u6CD5\uFF0C\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u533A\u7684\u5212\u5206\uFF0C\u4E16\u754C\u4EBA\u53E3\u5206\u5E03\u4E0E\u4EBA\u53E3\u8FC1\u79FB\uFF0C\u519C\u4E1A\u7684\u8D77\u6E90\u3001\u4F20\u64AD\u4E0E\u533A\u57DF\u5DEE\u5F02\uFF0C\u57CE\u5E02\u7684\u8D77\u6E90\u4E0E\u6269\u6563\uFF0C\u57CE\u5E02\u5F62\u6001\u7684\u533A\u57DF\u5DEE\u5F02\u4E0E\u7279\u70B9\uFF0C\u4E16\u754C\u4E3B\u8981\u8BED\u8A00\u3001\u5B97\u6559\u3001\u4EBA\u79CD\u7684\u7A7A\u95F4\u5206\u5E03\u53CA\u5176\u76F8\u4E92\u5173\u7CFB\uFF0C\u5730\u7406\u5927\u53D1\u73B0\u4E0E\u4E16\u754C\u6B96\u6C11\u4F53\u7CFB\u7684\u5F62\u6210\uFF0C\u4E16\u754C\u5730\u7F18\u653F\u6CBB\u4E0E\u4E16\u754C\u5730\u7406\u7CFB\u7EDF\u7684\u7A7A\u95F4\u7ED3\u6784\u7279\u70B9\uFF0C\u5168\u7403\u7ECF\u6D4E\u8BAE\u9898\u5316\u3001\u57CE\u5E02\u5316\u73B0\u8C61\u53CA\u5176\u4F34\u968F\u7684\u653F\u6CBB\u3001\u7ECF\u6D4E\u3001\u793E\u4F1A\u95EE\u9898\uFF0C\u7B49\u7B49\u3002\u00A0 \u300A\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u300B\u7684\u6388\u8BFE\u5185\u5BB9\u517C\u53CA\u81EA\u7136\u5730\u7406\u548C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u4E24\u5927\u65B9\u9762\uFF0C\u8BFE\u7A0B\u7EFC\u5408\u5438\u6536\u56FD\u5185\u5916\u76F8\u5173\u7684\u6700\u65B0\u6559\u6750\u548C\u7814\u7A76\u8BBA\u8457\u7684\u5185\u5BB9\uFF0C\u91C7\u53D6\u5730\u56FE\u3001\u7167\u7247\u3001\u56FE\u8868\u7B49\u8868\u73B0\u5F62\u5F0F\uFF0C\u529B\u56FE\u751F\u52A8\u6D45\u663E\u5730\u5C55\u793A\u4E16\u754C\u6587\u5316\u5730\u7406\u683C\u5C40\u7684\u57FA\u672C\u7A7A\u95F4\u5DEE\u5F02\u548C\u53D8\u5316\u8FC7\u7A0B\uFF0C\u6CE8\u610F\u4E13\u9898\u4ECB\u7ECD\u4E0E\u7EFC\u5408\u5206\u6790\u76F8\u7ED3\u5408\uFF0C\u7A7A\u95F4\u5DEE\u5F02\u5206\u6790\u4E0E\u4E16\u754C\u53D8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u76F8\u7ED3\u5408\uFF0C\u91CD\u89C6\u57F9\u517B\u5927\u5B66\u751F\u7684\u4E24\u79CD\u80FD\u529B\uFF1A\u8FD0\u7528\u5730\u7406\u5B66\u7684\u3001\u7A7A\u95F4\u7684\u773C\u5149\u6765\u89C2\u5BDF\u3001\u5206\u6790\u4E16\u754C\u4E0A\u6587\u5316\u73B0\u8C61\u7684\u80FD\u529B\u548C\u4ECE\u65F6\u95F4\u7684\u89D2\u5EA6\u6765\u770B\u5F85\u4E16\u754C\u4E0A\u6587\u5316\u73B0\u8C61\u53D1\u5C55\u53D8\u5316\u8FC7\u7A0B\u7684\u80FD\u529B\u3002\u00A0 \u8BFE\u7A0B\u6709\u671F\u4E2D\u548C\u671F\u672B\u4E24\u6B21\u8003\u8BD5\uFF0C\u6700\u7EC8\u6709\u671F\u672B\u6210\u7EE9\u3002</p>\n<p>\u00A0</p>\n<p><span>The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy.</span></p>\n\n\t<br><span>\u8BE5\u8BFE\u7A0B\u662F\u201C\u5317\u5927-\u5FB7\u7A3B\u7F51\u7EDC\u5F00\u653E\u8BFE\u7A0B\u201D\u4E2D\u7684\u4E00\u95E8\uFF0C\u7531\u5317\u4EAC\u5927\u5B66\u4E0E\u5FB7\u7A3B\u6559\u80B2\u8054\u5408\u63D0\u4F9B</span></span>" .

Please click the Register link to sign up for the newest course and stay tuned for announcements about the official start date. Please note that course materials for the first run of this course are no longer be available to learners.</p>\n<hr><p>This course will be offered in an experimental format and will not include any graded assignments or offer certificates at the conclusion of the course.</p>\n<p><em>The Poetry of Early New England </em>introduces students to the most important poets of the 17th century, including Anne Bradstreet, Michael Wigglesworth and Edward Taylor. Texts range from theological verse dramas to intimate love poems, \u00A0from meditations on nature, family and death to reflections on the civic and communal hopes of the New England migrants. Students will be exposed to relevant poetic forms and traditions, \u00A0to rare manuscript and printed materials, and they will have opportunities to practice and refine the way they read, and write about, poems. Course materials include video lectures, roundtable and online discussions--but also interactive exercises and interpretive expeditions to key New England sites.</p>\n<p>Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of poetry in America. \u00A0Treating individual figures (Poe, Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, Williams, Hughes), major poetic movements (Firesides, Modernist, New York, Confessional, L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E) and probing the many uses of poetry across changing times, the course provides a historical time line for the American poetic tradition while also giving students tools to approach any poetic tradition. Who, and what, are poems for? For poets? Readers? To give vent to the soul? To paint or sculpt with words? Alter consciousness? Raise cultural tone? Students will read, engage with, write about and also recite and record American poems.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p></span>" .

<http://mooclink.asu.edu/edx/6.00.2x> <http://cdhekne.github.io/mooc.owl#Course_Syllabus> "<span itemprop=\"description\"><p>6.00.2x is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. We have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics, so that they will have an idea of what\u2019s possible when the time comes later in their career to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal. That said, it is not a \u201Ccomputation appreciation\u201D course. Students will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. Topics covered include plotting, stochastic programs, probability and statistics, random walks, Monte Carlo simulations, modeling data, optimization problems, and clustering.</p>\n<p><strong>What will I learn?</strong> If you successfully complete this course, you will have:</p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tDeveloped some insight into the process of moving from an ambiguous problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tLearned a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tLearned how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don\u2019t easily succumb to closed form solutions,</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tLearned how to use computational tools, including simple statistical, machine learning, and plotting tools, to model and understand data.</li>\n</ul><p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press.

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.</p>\n<p>In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation, linear control, and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings, how to navigate along a series of waypoints, and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation.</p>\n<p>This course is intended for graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. The course is based on the TUM lecture \u201CVisual Navigation for Flying Robots\u201D which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.

Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications.\u00A0</p></span>" .

The on-campus version of this upper division computer science course draws about 600 Berkeley students each year.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is already all around you, from web search to video games. AI methods plan your driving directions, filter your spam, and focus your cameras on faces. AI lets you guide your phone with your voice and read foreign newspapers in English. Beyond today's applications, AI is at the core of many new technologies that will shape our future. From self-driving cars to household robots, advancements in AI help transform science fiction into real systems.</p>\n<p>CS188.1x focuses on Behavior from Computation. It will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. A specific emphasis will be on the statistical and decision\u2013theoretic modeling paradigm. By the end of this course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in stochastic and in adversarial settings. CS188.2x (to follow CS188.1x, precise date to be determined) will cover Reasoning and Learning. With this additional machinery your agents will be able to draw inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten digits and photographs. The techniques you learn in CS188x apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>This is a past/archived course.

Required programming experience is at the level of a first course for CS majors. The language used will be Python\u2014which in our experience students with programming experience pick up fairly quickly. Your best assessment on whether your programming background is sufficient is Project 1, which will go out in the first week, in which you will program an agent to intelligently navigate a maze. Math background: a first course in probability at the undergraduate level. We will post a self-assessment test in the first week." .

We can't promise you the answers, but we will explain what we do and don't know, and give you an up-to-date understanding of current research. This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level Maths and Physics to get the most out of this course.

The electronic structure and chemical bonding of materials is related to applications and engineering systems throughout the course. The on-campus version of the course has been taught for over thirty five years and is one of the largest classes at MIT. The class will cover the relationship between electronic structure, chemical bonding, and atomic order, and characterization of atomic arrangements in crystalline and amorphous solids: metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and polymers (including proteins). There will be topical coverage of organic chemistry, solution chemistry, acid-base equilibria, electrochemistry, biochemistry, chemical kinetics, diffusion, and phase diagrams. Examples will be drawn from industrial practice (including the environmental impact of chemical processes), from energy generation and storage (e.g. batteries and fuel cells), and from emerging technologies (e.g. photonic and biomedical devices). For the Summer 2014 class, edX registration and course materials are free.</p>\n\n<p>Students will complete weekly concept questions, watch videos and work on interspersed exercises, as well as submit weekly homework. Homework assignments may be submitted multiple times until the deadline. Those who earn a passing grade will get a free honor code certificate from MITx.</p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

During this process of change, the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces, hosted the Olympic Games, and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic \u201Cwealth.\u201D It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs, documentary films, TV programs, and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation by the U.S. armed forces; 2) consumption of images of the Emperor and the Imperial Household and redefinition as the imperial capital; 3) construction of the Olympic city Tokyo; and 4) changes in Shinjuku as a site of chaos and diversity. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia, such as Seoul, Beijing, and Bangkok, at the end of the twentieth century.</p>\n\n<p>This course is in the series, Visualizing Japan, and it will be offered immediately after the first course in the series, <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/VJx/vjx-visualizing-japan-2331#.U5u9UY1_vnX\" target=\"_blank\">Visualizing Japan (1850s - 1930s): Westernization, Protest, Modernity</a>, by MITx and HarvardX.</p></span>" .

Make sure to check for reruns of this course.\u00A0</p>\n<hr><p>12.340x introduces the basic science underpinning our knowledge of the climate system, how climate has changed in the past, and how it may change in the future. The course focuses on the fundamental energy balance in the climate system, between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation, and how this balance is affected by greenhouse gases. We will also discuss physical processes that shape the climate, such as atmospheric and oceanic convection and large-scale circulation, solar variability, orbital mechanics, and aerosols, as well as the evidence for past and present climate change. We will discuss climate models of varying degrees of complexity, and you will be able to run a model of a single column of the Earth's atmosphere, which includes many of the important elements of simulating climate change. Together, this range of topics forms the scientific basis for our understanding of anthropogenic (human-influenced) climate change.</p>\n<p>We will <em>not</em> cover issues regarding policy responses to climate change. Rather, <em>Global Warming Science</em> is designed to be a strictly scientific introduction to this important topic.</p>\n<p>12.340x is geared toward students with some mathematical and scientific background, but does not require any prior knowledge of climate or atmospheric science. See the prerequisites section for more details.</p>\n<p><strong>Course Structure</strong><br>\n\tThe course will be divided into weekly sections which will be released sequentially. Each section will include a set of lecture videos and practice exercises that students will be expected to work through. Additional background readings may be assigned, all of which will be sourced from material freely available online. The course will be graded based on weekly online problem sets, as well as an online final exam.\u00A0</p></span>" .
